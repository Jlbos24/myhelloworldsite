    <div class="aboutmep">
        <p> I am from South Africa and have been living in Leeds for the last 4 years. I moved over here because I wanted to challenge myself in a new country away from familiar environments,
            I guess to see what I else I could do with my life. I have Bcom Degree in Economics which I studied at the University of South Africa, which is the Open University equivalent in the UK.
            I studied while working in tech support, sales and then account management for 5 years till 2016 with FenyaSoft(a company who develop their own business management software) when I moved here. 
            While in the UK I have had the opportunity to experience the world of IT recruitment...well enough said.
            I want to start a career in software development because I feel like it will be an environment that requires continuous learning and challenges, and I need this to keep motivated and interested 
            in the work im doing. I feel like I can be creative and will physically see the outcome of the effors I am putting in.
